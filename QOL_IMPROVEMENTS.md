# Quality of Life Improvements

## Latest Updates (2025-10-30)

### üé≤ NEW: Random Choice Shuffling (Anti-Cheese Feature)
**Issue**: Players could spam-click the same button (e.g., always pressing "1") to win
**Fix**: Implemented random choice shuffling for every event
- Choices appear in **random order** each time using Fisher-Yates algorithm
- Players must **read and think** about each decision
- No more memorizing optimal button sequences
- Keyboard shortcuts still work - they map to the displayed order
- Greatly increases replayability and strategic depth

See `ANTI_CHEESE_UPDATE.md` for full technical details.

### 1. Fixed Number Formatting Bug üî¢
**Issue**: Valuation of $27,979.7M was displaying incorrectly
**Fix**: Updated `formatMoney()` function to properly handle billions
- Now displays as `$27.98B` instead of `$27979.7M`
- Formatting hierarchy:
  - Billions: $X.XXB (2 decimal places)
  - Millions: $X.XM (1 decimal place)
  - Thousands: $X.XK (1 decimal place)
  - Under $1K: $XXX (full number)

**New Shortcuts Added**:
- **Start Screen**: Press `Enter` to start the game

- **End Game Screen**:
  - Press `Enter` to play again
  - Press `Esc` to share results

**Visual Hints**: All buttons now display their keyboard shortcuts in parentheses

### 3. Fixed Input Handling Bug üéÆ
