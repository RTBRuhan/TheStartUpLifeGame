# startup life

a game about building a startup and probably failing

## what is this

you make decisions. your startup either dies or you get rich. that's it.

99% of startups fail. can you be the 1%?

## how to play

just open `index.html` in your browser

or if you want to be fancy:
```
python -m http.server 8000
```

then go to `localhost:8000`

## controls

- click buttons or press 1, 2, 3 on your keyboard
- enter to continue
- read the story and make choices

## features i guess

- story events that change based on your choices
- manage money, team, product, users, all that stuff
- co-founder who might betray you
- random events so you cant just spam the same button
- you can actually win but its hard

## tips

- dont run out of money
- read the choices carefully (they shuffle each time)
- keep your team happy
- idk figure it out

## tech
