# ðŸš€ The Startup Lifecycle

> **An interactive visual narrative of a startup's journey from Idea to Exit (or Death)**

## Overview

The Startup Lifecycle is an educational and artistic exploration of the chaotic journey of building a startup. Watch as your startup probabilistically transitions through various states based on your decisions and a bit of randomness. Will you reach a successful Exit, or will you face Death and potential Rebirth?

### ðŸŽ¯ One-Liner Pitch

*"Experience the beautiful chaos of startup life through an interactive, probabilistic state machine with stunning visuals."*

## Features

- **11 Distinct States**: Idea, Hype, Funding, Growth, Chaos, Pivot, Scale, Exit, Debt, Death, Rebirth
- **Probabilistic Transitions**: Each state has weighted probabilities for transitioning to other states
- **User Actions**: Hire, Cut Costs, Seek Funding, Launch, and Pivot - each modifying transition probabilities
- **Stunning Visuals**: Each state has a unique visual representation with smooth morphing transitions (powered by p5.js)
- **Interactive Timeline**: See your startup's journey visualized over time (powered by D3.js)
- **Multiple Seed Types**: Tech, Consumer, or Biotech - each with different characteristics
- **Auto-Simulation**: Run hundreds of simulations to explore different outcomes
- **Export Options**: Download your journey as JSON or capture visuals as PNG
- **Keyboard Controls**: Full keyboard accessibility support
- **Shareable Snapshots**: Share your startup's current state on social media

## Quick Start

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AUTHOR_HANDLE/startup-lifecycle.git
   cd startup-lifecycle
   ```

2. **Serve the files:**
   
   You can use any static file server. Here are a few options:
   
   **Python 3:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   
   **Node.js (with http-server):**
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   
   **PHP:**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### No Build Step Required!

This project uses vanilla JavaScript and CDN-hosted libraries. Just serve the files and go!

## How to Play

1. **Enter your startup name** and choose a startup type (Tech, Consumer, or Biotech)
2. **Click "Spin a Startup"** to begin
3. **Use the Play button** to auto-advance or **Step** to go tick-by-tick
4. **Intervene with actions** to influence your startup's trajectory:
   - **Hire** (H): Increase growth potential, but raises burn rate
   - **Cut Costs** (C): Reduce burn rate, but may slow growth
   - **Seek Funding** (F): Boost funding probability, but risk chaos
   - **Launch** (L): Generate hype around your product
   - **Pivot** (P): Force an immediate pivot (use wisely!)

5. **Watch the timeline** to see your journey unfold
6. **Share or export** your results when done

## Customizing the Simulation

### Editing Transition Probabilities

The heart of the simulation is the `data/transitions.json` file. You can modify:

- **Transition probabilities** between states
- **Seed type modifiers** that affect different startup types
- **State names** and structure

#### Example transition entry:

```json
"Growth": {
  "Scale": 0.6,
  "Chaos": 0.3,
  "Pivot": 0.1
}
```

This means when in the **Growth** state:
- 60% chance to transition to **Scale**
- 30% chance to transition to **Chaos**
- 10% chance to transition to **Pivot**

**Important:** Probabilities should sum to 1.0 for each state.

### Adding New States

1. Add the state name to the `states` array in `transitions.json`
2. Define its transitions in the `transitions` object
3. Add visual representation in `assets/js/visualStages.js`:
   - Add color to `stateColors`
   - Add parameters to `stateParams`
   - Create a `drawYourState()` function
4. Update the switch statement in `renderStateVisual()`
