## 💰 Resource Management Tips

### Cash Flow Rules:
1. **Never let money go below $10K** - You'll panic and make bad choices
2. **Raise money when at $20K** - Before it's urgent
3. **Monthly burn** = Team size × $3K

### Growth Formula:
1. **Get product to 75%+** as fast as possible
2. **Launch when product > 70%** - Don't wait for perfection
3. **Focus on revenue** - Users without revenue = no exit
4. **Keep morale > 50%** - Low morale kills productivity

### Valuation Math:
- Revenue × 6 = Base valuation
- Users × $20-$50 = Additional value
- Product quality multiplier
- Reputation boost

**Example Winning Metrics:**
- $10K MRR × 6 = $60K base
- 1000 users × $30 = $30K
- Product (85%) × Rep (70%) × Morale (60%) = 3.6x multiplier
- Total: ~$25M+ 🎉
