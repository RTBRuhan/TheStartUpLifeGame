## 🎮 **WHAT PLAYERS NEED NOW**

1. **Read each event carefully**
2. **Consider current resources**
   - Low money? Choose cheap options
   - Low morale? Choose sustainable options
   - Need revenue? Choose monetization options
3. **Think long-term**
   - Early game: Conserve cash
   - Mid game: Build revenue
   - Late game: Strategic growth
4. **Don't follow patterns**
   - No "always choose X" strategy works
   - Context is everything

---

## 💡 **DESIGN NOTES**

The rebalance focuses on:
- **Making option 2 viable** - it was rarely the best choice before
- **Punishing overconfidence** - aggressive moves (option 1) now often backfire
- **Rewarding strategic thinking** - smart moves (option 2/3) often win
- **Creating trade-offs** - no perfect choice, just better ones for your situation
- **Realistic outcomes** - bootstrapping > bad deals, focus > feature wars, story > raw metrics

---

## 🚀 **PLAYTESTING RECOMMENDATIONS**

Players should try:
1. **Conservative strategy**: Mostly option 2/3 in early game
2. **Balanced strategy**: Mix all options based on context
3. **Aggressive strategy**: Will likely FAIL now (as it should!)

The goal is **70% win rate for strategic players, 10% for button mashers**.
